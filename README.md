# WebDev-Team-15 Project Description


***Problem:*** Smaller artists have trouble connecting with successful producers.

***User 1 (admin): Producer***
- Find artists
- Contact artists
- Pushing out produced tracks

***User 2: Artist***
- Find producer
- Contact producers
- Getting music discovered

***User 3: Listener***
- Find new music
- Find new artists

***Strategy:*** This web application allows artists to post demo tracks for producers to listen to. Producers and artists are able to connect with each other based on these tracks. The artist can choose to make their demos private, for producersâ€™ listening only, or public, available to the general public (listeners) as well.

***API: SoundCloud***
SoundCloud is the leading audio platform that enables anyone to upload, record, promote and share their sounds across the web. The SoundCloud API makes most of the features from SoundCloud.com available to app developers. With the help of its SDKs it's easy to integrate functionality like audio sharing and recording directly into iOS, Android and web apps.
