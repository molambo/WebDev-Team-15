# WebDev-Team-15 Project Description


***Problem:*** Smaller artists have trouble connecting with successful producers.

***User 1 (admin): Producer***
- Find artists
- Contact artists
- Pushing out produced tracks

***User 2: Artist***
- Find producer
- Contact producers
- Getting music discovered

***User 3: Listener***
- Find new music
- Find new artists

***Strategy:*** This web application allows artists to post demo tracks for producers to listen to. Producers and artists are able to connect with each other based on these tracks. The artist can choose to make their demos private, for producersâ€™ listening only, or public, available to the general public (listeners) as well.

***API: YouTube Data***

YouTube Data API allows you to add YouTube functionality to your site and search for content:
- The API allows you can add a variety of YouTube features to your application. The features include: uploading videos, managing playlists and subscriptions, updating channel settings, etc.
- Use the API to search for videos matching specific search terms, topics, locations, publication dates, and much more. The APIs search.list method also supports searches for playlists and channels.
